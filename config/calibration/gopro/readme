The program has a single argument: the name of its configuration file. If none is given then it will try to open the one named “default.xml”. Here's a sample configuration file in XML format. In the configuration file you may choose to use camera as an input, a video file or an image list. If you opt for the last one, you will need to create a configuration file where you enumerate the images to use. Here’s an example of this. The important part to remember is that the images need to be specified using the absolute path or the relative one from your application’s working directory. You may find all this in the samples directory mentioned above.
